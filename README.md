2 **Idea** 
> **Bluetooth Module connected with MCU1 , reciveing   Commands as a Characters then communicate with MCU1 by UART protocol** 
> **depened on what UART recived , the MCU1 will Commuincate with MCU2 via SPI protocol then control 3 LEDS connected with it** 
> **each MCU has LCD to view the process** 

3 **Code Files**
  > **There's two  MCU1 directory containe Source Code for MCU1 , same thing with MCU2 directory**
 
4 **Simulation Video**
